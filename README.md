  - Filter drills by name, category, and rank.
  - Assign drills to sessions, add notes, and reorder with drag-and-drop.
  - Adjust drill duration per session instance.
- **Session Templates**:
  - Save any session as a reusable template.
  - Apply templates to any date.
  - Delete templates as needed.
- **Persistent Storage**: All data is saved in Firestore and synced in real time.
- **Mobile-Friendly UI**: Responsive, touch-friendly, and easy to use on any device.
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated buttons, clear modals, and progress indicators.
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Automatic deployment to Firebase Hosting on every push to `main`.

## Known Issues

- The calendar month/year label (e.g., "June 2025") font size does not increase as expected due to internal library styling. Needs further investigation and fix to allow for larger, more visible header text.

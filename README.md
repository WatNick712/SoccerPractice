## Known Issues

- The calendar month/year label (e.g., "June 2025") font size does not increase as expected due to internal library styling. Needs further investigation and fix to allow for larger, more visible header text.
- The soccer ball progress icon on the calendar does not perfectly match the planned/total time ratio. The visual fill may not accurately reflect the session planning progress and needs further refinement for precise feedback.

## Responsive Design

This app is fully responsive and works well on all screen sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers. All views and modals automatically adapt to the device being used, ensuring a smooth experience for every user.

## Features / Improvements

- Session details panel is now scrollable and always visible above the fixed bottom bar, with extra bottom padding to prevent overlap with action buttons.
- Calendar and session details are both centered with equal spacing on all sides for a modern, balanced UI.
- Drills/Exercises and Previous Practice Sessions buttons are always accessible and do not overlap content.
- Robust support for team-based data separation: all drills, sessions, and templates are scoped to the selected team.
- Modern, responsive layout for all main app panels.

## Data Migration

- A one-time migration function was used to add the `teamId` field to all existing drills, sessions, and sessionTemplates in Firestore. This ensures all data is now properly scoped to the current team and visible in the app.

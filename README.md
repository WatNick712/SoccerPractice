- **Drill/Exercise Management**:
  - Add, edit, and delete drills with name, description, duration, link, categories (including Water Break), and rank (1â€“5 stars).
  - Filter drills by name, category, and rank.
  - Assign drills to sessions, add notes, and reorder with drag-and-drop.
  - Adjust drill duration per session instance.
- **Session Templates**:
  - Save any session as a reusable template.
  - Apply templates to any date (templates are scoped to the selected team).
  - Delete templates as needed.

- **Mobile-Friendly UI**: Responsive, touch-friendly, and easy to use on any device.

## Known Issues

- The calendar month/year label (e.g., "June 2025") font size does not increase as expected due to internal library styling. Needs further investigation and fix to allow for larger, more visible header text.
- The soccer ball progress icon on the calendar does not perfectly match the planned/total time ratio. The visual fill may not accurately reflect the session planning progress and needs further refinement for precise feedback.
- For performance, only sessions for the currently visible month are loaded and shown on the calendar. If you want to see icons for other months, navigate to that month and the data will load.

## Responsive Design

This app is fully responsive and works well on all screen sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers. All views and modals automatically adapt to the device being used, ensuring a smooth experience for every user.

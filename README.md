- All user information must be stored online (in the cloud), so users can access their data from any device, anywhere with an internet connection.

## Known Issues

- The calendar month/year label (e.g., "June 2025") font size does not increase as expected due to internal library styling. Needs further investigation and fix to allow for larger, more visible header text.
